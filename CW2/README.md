# Coursework 2 

One member of your group should fork this project and then add the other members of the group as collaborators on the project.

When working on the project, remember to do a `git pull` prior to starting your work so that you have the latest working version. 

When you have finished a bit of work, remember to do `git add` and `git commit` to update your local copy. Then `git pull` to ensure that there are no new updates, before doing a `git push` to share your updates with the rest of the group. 

## Task 1: XML File

Populate the file `data.xml` with your data.

## Task 2: XML Schema

Populate the file `schema.xsd` with your XML Schema.

## Task 3: XPath Queries

Each group member should write two XPath queries. Each query should be in a separate file and include as a comment at the start of the file a statement as to the intent of the query. For example, your file should look something like
```xml
<!-- Query to retrieve all books -->
//books
```

Your query files should be placed in the `xpaths` directory and have the file extension `.xpath`.
